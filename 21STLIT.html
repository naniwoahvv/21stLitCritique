                    BIAG NI LAM-ANG<br>
                    Biag Ni Lam-ang, or “The life of Lam-ang” in English, is an Ilokano poem written by Pedro Bucaneg in
                    the 1600s. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    SUMMARY<br>
                    Don Juan and Namongan were a couple that lived in Nalbuan, La Union. While Namongan was
                pregnant with their son, Don Juan left to confront and punish a group of igorots. Don Juan still had not returned
                when Namongan gave birth to their son, Lam-ang. As he grew older, he’d ask where his father was, so
                Namongan told him. Lam-ang was determined to find him, but his mother was very hesitant to let him go. <br><br>
                Nonetheless, he set out towards the Igorots, only to find his father’s head stuck on a pole in their village.
                This angered Lam-ang so much, he killed the whole village. He decided that he was going to see the woman he
                wanted to woo, Ines Kannoyan, who lived in Calanutian. Upon arriving at their residence, the rooster he had
                brought along crowed, and a nearby house fell. This made Ines look out her window. The dog that he too was  
                with barked, and the house rose back up in an instant. Ines’ parents seeing this, agreed to have them get married,
                only if he was able to give a dowry that doubled her parents’ wealth. Lam-ang was able to accomplish this by
                bringing them a boat full of gold. <br><br>
                As a wedding tradition, he was to swim in the river for the shellfish called “rarang”. instead, he dove
                straight into the mouth of a water monster “berkakeng” or in other versions, a “tiaon-tiaon”, a big water
                monster. He died, but with the help of Marcos, they were able to retrieve back his bones, which they brought on
                land and placed a cloth over. The rooster and dog that Lam Ang had brought with him circled it and barked
                slowly, and the bones shaped back into lam-ang. With that, he lived. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                SETTING<br>
                The story takes place in pre-historic times before the Spanish rule in the Philippines. Cultural Ilokano
                and Igorot groups were still prevalent and their traditions. All significant events happened in three villages. The
                Igorot’s village, Lam-ang’s hometown Nalbuan, and Ines’ hometown in Calanutian.<br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">  
            CHARACTERS<br>
                There are 6 main characters in the epic “Biag Ni Lam-ang”. First is the main character lam-ang, a
                dynamic character in the story. He was directly revealed or introduced in the poem as soon as he was birthed.
                He was described as authoritative, brave, and strong, explicitly mentioning supernatural powers. He is also very
                persistent with his goals and decisions despite their violent consequences, such as when he confronted the
                Igorots regarding his father or his battle with Sumarang on the way to Ines’ hometown at Kalanutian, Ilocos Sur.
                Reading the story implies that Lam-ang rapidly developed into adulthood as he went on to his quests in the span
                of a short time, likely because of the supernatural powers he has in the epic. It was mentioned that right after
                birth he sought out his father despite having legs as thin as bamboo shoots, fingers like needles and having been
                born just before his 9th month in Namongan’s womb as his mother describes. <br><br>
                Next is Lam-ang’s mother, Namongan. She had been a flat character throughout the story. She had
                authority over Don Juan, her husband as seen in the first 18 stanzas of the poem. She’d ask him to make her a
                bed and check on their crops from time to time. Yet, she was subjected to her son’s authority after he was born.
                Despite her pleading with him to not go to the Igorots, or to stop pursuing Ines Kannoyan, his perseverance
                would not allow him to listen to her. Namongan has no choice but to let him have his way and pray for his
                safety every time he sets out to go out of the village.<br> <br>
                The third main character is Ines Kannoyan who is from Kalanutian, Ilocos Sur. She is Lam-ang’s love
                interest in this epic. Just like Namongan, she is a flat character in this story. Was introduced directly as a
                clean-living maiden, a “hard-to-get” girl by her suitors who grew up in a wealthy family. She was also said to be
                able to spin nine spools overnight, which made her desirable to Lam-ang. She represented the women during
                that time well, obedient, quiet and were always under the authority of her parents and then her husband.
                The last three are Don Juan (Lam-ang’s father), Unnayan (Ines’ mother), and her husband. They are
                mainly supporting characters in the Epic. Don Juan was a hardworking husband for Namongan, which
                represented the role of men during that period. They were the breadwinners of the family and did all the hard
                labour in the fields or rivers.<br><br>
                Unnayan and her husband were a wealthy couple in their village. They raised Ines’ playing with balls of
                gold. Ilokos are known to focus on efficiency, productivity, and wise money spending, which might explain
                their social status in that community.<br>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                PLOT<br><br>
                The plot of the story had three climaxes. 1st was the confrontation of Lam-ang and the Igorots, 2nd was
                his courtship for Ines Kannoyan and 3rd was Lam-ang’s death when he got eaten by a water monster. The story
                ends in the third climax without a falling action event to follow up after the scene or an epilogue. These three
                climaxes had falling and rising action events in between. Every character in the story was directly introduced as
                they entered the scene, even the supporting roles such as Sumarang. Biag Ni Lam-ang was narrated in the third
                person point of view, allowing readers to get all of the character’s thoughts and perspectives in a scene. <br>
                </p>
               <p style="text-align: justify;">
                CONTEXTS<br><br>
                Biag ni Lam-ang reflects the way of living before Spanish rule over the Philippines. We can see this
                through how the villages are described in the poem. There are mentions of nipa huts and traditionally made
                furniture like Namongan's reclining bed from bamboo shoots. There are explicit portrayals of gender roles. In
                the epic, women are described and portrayed as kind, gentle, nurturing, loyal and clean-lived ladies just like
                Ines Kannoyan. They followed the men’s lead and assisted them in their needs just like how Namongan ordered
                Lam-ang’s sisters to aid him as he bathed in the river. On the other hand, the (ideal) men were reflected through
                Lam-ang’s character; brave, strong, providers and protectors of their loved ones and community.<br><br>
                We can also see the camaraderie within and between communities and the violent tribal wars during that
                time. The Igorots were known to firmly believe in the philosophy “an eye for an eye” and hunt down the heads
                of their rivalling tribes, thus explaining why Don Juan’s head ended up in a pole in their village. <br><br>
                The connection of Ilokano culture with folklore, mythical creatures and supernatural events is observed.
                The traditional way of courtship and grand weddings can also be observed in the story. Men would do their best
                to stand out amongst other suitors for the girl they want and impress their parents by meeting the requirements
                they ask of them before giving their daughter’s hand in marriage. The weddings involved big feasts between the
                communities of the bride and groom.<br><br>
                Although the epic is based on pre-historic times, there are subtle hints of Spanish influence like the
                mention of Spanish suitors in the story and Christianity. Despite that, the story went on while retaining its
                Indigenous elements and plot. There have been multiple adaptations of this epic, one even in Spanish as an "awit"

                        EL FILIBUSTERISMO <br><br>
                        José Rizal's El Filibusterismo, or "The Reign of Greed," is a seminal book in Philippine literature and
                        history. It is both a strong accusation of the oppressive policies of the Spanish colonial government and a plea to
                        the Filipino people to acknowledge the need for immediate social change. This book, which promotes change
                        and exposes the realities of injustice and corruption in society, is the peak of Rizal's revolutionary views. El
                        Filibusterismo transcends literature with its rich story and cast of characters. It represents the fight for
                        independence and Filipino identity. It serves as a revolutionary spark, igniting the movement that would
                        eventually result in the uprising against the Spanish in the Philippines. <br><br>
                        In conclusion, El Filibusterismo remains a significant work not only for its artistic value but also for its
                        role in inspiring the Philippine Revolution. Through its complex characters and setting, the novel provides a
                        vivid portrayal of the social and political realities under Spanish rule. The novel’s ultimate message, warning
                        against the dangers of hatred and blind vengeance, makes it a timeless piece advocating for thoughtful and
                        unified resistance. To improve, Rizal’s depiction of the ideological spectrum could be expanded to include more
                        perspectives, highlighting the nuances of Filipino resistance even further.</p>
        
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        WHY DID WE CHOOSE THIS STORY<br><br>
                        José Rizal's El Filibusterismo is a timeless masterpiece with significant implications for comprehending
                        the Filipino battle for freedom, making it an excellent subject for literary research. Historically, it was
                        instrumental in sparking the Philippine Revolution by exposing the corruption of both the Spanish colonial
                        authority and the Church, thereby stoking nationalist feelings that drove the country's struggle for
                        independence. The novel's themes of social injustice, moral decay, and the battle between reform and revolution
                        are still important today, as they reflect current challenges of corruption, inequality, and political instability.
                        Characters such as Simoun, a dissatisfied reformist-turned-radical, and Basilio, an educated youth dissatisfied
                        by the system, exemplify Filipinos' internal conflict over whether real change can be achieved through peaceful
                        or more radical means.<br><br>
                        The abuse of innocent characters such as Juli demonstrates the vulnerability of underprivileged
                        communities even in modern society. El Filibusterismo is a cautionary tale against divisiveness, urging readers
                        to prioritize togetherness, education, and moral integrity to achieve long-term change. As a literary work, it
                        influenced the country's history and continues to guide current and future generations by emphasizing the risks
                        of oppression and the intricacies of actual transformation. Through this perspective, it becomes a great tool for
                        comprehending the past and managing the difficulties of the present while inspiring a more just and proactive
                        future.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                       SUMMARY<br><br>
                        El Filibusterismo, which is set thirteen years after the events of Noli Me Tangere, tells the tale of
                        Simoun, a wealthy jeweler, and an unusual character who turns out to be Crisostomo Ibarra from Noli Me
                        Tangere in disguise. Having undergone a transformation, he is now resolved to ignite a revolt against the
                        Spanish government in order to take revenge for Maria Clara, his beloved, and to obtain justice for the suffering
                        of the Filipino people. The story is set in a variety of locations in Manila and the provinces that surround it,
                        capturing the colonial atmosphere of the late 19th-century Philippines. Simoun plants the seeds of discontent
                        and manipulates influential people in society to plan a rebellion. His well thought-out scheme is ultimately
                        stopped, resulting in a tragic outcome.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        CHARACTERS<br><br>
                        Each of the novel’s characters symbolizes different aspects of Philippine society:
                        In El Filibusterismo, Simoun represents the repressed fury of the Filipino people and stands for revolt,
                        vengeance, and change. He started off as Crisostomo Ibarra from Noli Me Tangere, a peaceful reformist. After
                        losing everything, he returns as Simoun, a resentful jeweler who wants to overthrow the system violently. The
                        clearest example of this change is found in Chapter 7, "Simoun," where he reveals his audacious scheme to
                        incite a revolution by coercing the affluent and fostering corruption to drive society to its breaking point. His
                        metamorphosis and lust for vengeance represent the intense annoyance of a people pushed to their breaking
                        point.<br><br>
                        Basilio represents the future of the Philippines and the educated youth. He was an orphaned youngster in
                        Noli Me Tangere who saw his mother Sisa die, signifying the agony of the common people. As a medical
                        student pursuing personal achievement, he is depicted in El Filibusterismo, Chapter 6, "Basilio," with the belief
                        that hard effort and education may bring about change. But given Juli's passing and the injustices at the
                        university, he is becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the system, which represents the wasted potential of
                        people who, despite their initial belief in reform, are ultimately destroyed by oppression. His final involvement
                        in Simoun's scheme signifies the end of his hope for nonviolent change.<br><br>
                        Basilio's friend Isagani represents the idealistic youth who thinks that reform may be achieved
                        peacefully. Chapter 34, "The Wedding," where he opposes Simoun's plot to blow up Paulita Gomez's wedding
                        reception and argues that violence will only cause more suffering, highlights his aversion to Simoun's
                        aggressive ways. His psychological struggle is a metaphor for the struggle of Filipinos caught between the harsh
                        realities of oppression and the dreams of reform. The internal conflict among Filipinos over whether
                        independence should be achieved peacefully or violently is symbolized by this altercation.<br><br>
                        Padres Salvi and Irene represent the church's oppressive authority and complicity in the persecution of
                        the Filipino people. In Chapter 11, "Los Baños," Padre Salvi displays his manipulative skills and hypocrisy as
                        he gently sways the Governor-General in order to uphold the church's power. In contrast, Chapter 19, "The
                        Fuse," presents Padre Irene as a cunning and dishonest priest who poses as a friend to the students in order to
                        betray them and use their cause for his own gain. The hypocrisy, lust, and moral decline of the religious
                        organizations that dominated the Filipino people are revealed by both characters.<br><br>
                       Basilio's sweetheart Juli represents the purity and pain of the typical Filipino woman living under the
                        tyrannical system. Her destiny serves as a sobering reminder of the weak people's exploitation and fragility. In
                        Chapter 33, "The Final Stand," Padre Camorra's attempt to rape Juli drives her to her death. Juli is made to work
                        as a servant in order to pay Basilio's ransom. Her untimely demise stands up for the agony of innumerable
                        innocent Filipinos who are caught in the crossfire of institutionalized abuse.<br><br>
                        Don Custodio, Ben Zayb, and other Spanish officials embody the corruption and incompetence of the
                        colonial government. Don Custodio, introduced in Chapter 14, is a self-important official who dismisses the
                        students’ petition for an academy, choosing instead to focus on meaningless reforms to maintain his power. Ben
                        Zayb, the newspaper writer shown in Chapter 9, represents the distorted portrayal of truth by the colonial media,
                        twisting facts to serve the interests of the ruling class. These characters mock the indifferent and self-serving
                        nature of the colonial administration, highlighting its ineffectiveness and disconnection from the people’s needs.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        PLOT AND SETTING<br><br>
                        The plot of El Filibusterismo is important since it shows the futility and tragedy of pursuing revenge and
                        violence, comparing it with the necessity for genuine reform and enlightenment. The settings, which range from
                        the luxurious homes of Manila's elite to the miserable lives of the common people, reflect the country's
                        socioeconomic and political structure. Rizal emphasizes the urgent need for unity and awareness among
                        Filipinos by illustrating the gap between downtrodden Filipinos and the ruling Spaniards.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        CONTEXT<br><br>
                        El Filibusterismo was written during a time of great political disorder in the Philippines, at the height of
                        Spanish colonial rule. The novel reflects the widespread discontent and the rise of nationalist sentiments. It was
                        inspired by events such as the Cavite Mutiny of 1872 and the execution of the Gomburza priests, which
                        intensified anti-colonial feelings among Filipinos. Rizal’s depiction of corrupt officials and the exploitation of
                        the native population is rooted in the realities of Spanish domination.<br><br>
                        The novel depicts the rigid class structures imposed by colonial rule. The ilustrados (educated Filipinos)
                        are caught between loyalty to the Spanish regime and their identity as Filipinos. Simoun’s transformation from
                        the idealistic Ibarra to the vengeful revolutionary shows the impact of societal oppression and personal loss.
                        Social inequality is a key theme, as seen in the characters of Juli and Basilio, who are subjected to injustices that
                        shape their views on resistance.<br><br>
                        Rizal's novel illustrates the cultural conflicts brought about by colonization, such as the clash between
                        Western values and Filipino traditions. The Spanish regime’s imposition of Catholicism and European customs
                        eroded native Filipino identity, a theme represented by characters like Padre Salvi and the hypocritical clergy.
                        Through El Filibusterismo, Rizal emphasized the importance of preserving Filipino culture and identity amidst
                        the colonial onslaught.<br><br>
                        Ideologically, El Filibusterismo advocates for national identity, unity, and resistance against tyranny.
                        Simoun’s character represents the extremist approach, using violence as a means to achieve change. In contrast,
                        the character of Isagani symbolizes the moderate reformists who seek to achieve progress through peaceful
                       means. This ideological clash mirrors the broader debate among Filipinos on whether to adopt radical or
                        peaceful approaches to achieve independence.            </p>

                SALINGKIT: A 1986 DIARY <br>
                Salingkit: A 1986 Diary captures the transformative political and social upheaval of the People Power
                Revolution of 1986 through the lens of youth and personal experience of the main character. It represents the
                collective desire for freedom, resistance against dictatorship, and the transition from fear to hope. The novel not
                only portrays the struggle for democracy but also serves as a testament to the power of ordinary citizens,
                particularly the youth, in shaping national identity and political change. <br><br>
                The story has a significant contribution to Philippine literature because it captures the spirit of a
                transformative moment in history through the eyes of a young protagonist. The novel’s exploration of themes
                such as fear, hope, resistance, and identity make it a powerful narrative that goes beyond the political, touching
                on universal themes of personal growth and moral courage. Through its richly drawn characters and vivid
                setting, the story serves as both a historical document and a timeless reminder of the importance of standing up
                for one’s beliefs. By intertwining the personal with the political, Salingkit encourages readers to reflect on their
                own role in shaping history, making it a resonant work in both its local and global contexts.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                SUMMARY<br><br>
                Salingkit: A 1986 Diary is a coming-of-age story set against the backdrop of the People Power
                Revolution, which led to the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines. The story follows the
                diary entries of a young girl named Kitty Eugenio who also went by “Goro”, as she navigates her teenage years
                amidst the turbulent political climate of 1986. Living in Metro Manila, Kitty recounts her personal struggles,
                family dynamics, and growing awareness of the injustices around her. As the revolution progresses, she
                witnesses the courage of her fellow Filipinos and becomes increasingly involved in the fight for freedom. The
                plot moves from personal conflicts to larger social ones, depicting the intertwining of the personal and political,
                while the setting—Manila during the revolution—serves as a powerful metaphor for both chaos and renewal.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                CHARACTERS<br><br>
                Kitty Eugenio, the protagonist, a young girl whose diary entries provide the narrative of the story. Kitty
                represents the voice of the youth during the revolution—innocent, curious, and gradually becoming aware of the
                political realities around her. Her evolution symbolizes the awakening of the Filipino people to the need for
                resistance and change. <br><br>
                Kitty’s parents and relatives represent different facets of society under the Marcos regime. Her father, a
                rallyist, represented those who were actively fighting for their freedom during that period of oppression whilst
                her mother represented those who chose to be silent and find a better life someplace else other than the
                Philippines. Alan, kitty’s cousin, was no different from her father. He too actively participated in activism
                against the government. He represents the youth whl have already opened their eyes to the realities of the
                country’s politics and have chosen a side to stand with.<br><br>
                Kitty’s peers, some of whom are apathetic while others are highly political, mirror the divided state of
                Filipino youth during this period—some willing to take action and others preferring to remain detached. This
                division highlights the challenge of mobilizing a generation for political action.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
               PLOT AND SETTING <br>
                The setting of Salingkit: A 1986 Diary is crucial as it takes place in Metro Manila, the epicentre of the
                People Power Revolution. The choice of setting anchors the novel in a historical reality, making it not just a
                story of personal growth, but a documentation of a nation’s transformation. The streets of Manila, where Kitty
                and her family witness protests, demonstrations, and eventually the downfall of the Marcos regime, serve as a
                microcosm of the larger national struggle. The plot’s development from Kitty’s mundane concerns to her
                involvement in the revolution parallels the awakening of Filipino society—from passive acceptance to active
                resistance—making the personal deeply political. </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                CONTEXTS <br><br>
                The novel is set during the pivotal period of the People Power Revolution in 1986, which marked the
                end of the 21-year dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. The revolution was a culmination of years of widespread
                human rights abuses, censorship, and political oppression. Kitty’s narrative reflects the fear, confusion, and
                hope that many Filipinos felt during this time. Specific diary entries describe the assassination of opposition
                leader Benigno Aquino Jr., the rigged elections of 1986, and the mass protests that followed, which are all
                historically accurate portrayals of events leading up to the revolution.<br><br>
                Salingkit captures the social dynamics of a society under authoritarian rule. The story reveals the fear
                and suspicion that pervaded everyday interactions, as depicted in the scenes where Kitty’s family discusses
                politics in hushed tones. The novel also highlights the role of the Church and civil society, who were
                instrumental in rallying people against the dictatorship. The juxtaposition of kitty’s personal life—crushes,
                schoolwork, and family tensions—with the larger social unrest mirrors the dual realities faced by many
                Filipinos at the time.<br><br>
                The novel delves into Filipino cultural values, such as bayanihan (communal unity) and hiya (a sense of
                shame), and how these were either suppressed or amplified by the dictatorship. Kitty’s narrative also explores
                the role of pakikisama (getting along with others) and its limits under oppressive conditions. These cultural
                values are tested as the characters grapple with the choice between safety and resistance, making the story a
                reflection of the collective psyche of Filipinos during the revolution.<br><br>
                Ideologically, Salingkit portrays the conflict between authoritarianism and democracy, between fear and
                courage. The Marcos regime, represented by the unseen forces controlling Kitty’s world, stands for
                authoritarian rule and the suppression of dissent. In contrast, the People Power Revolution, with its nonviolent
                protests and the symbolic use of yellow as a colour of resistance, represents the Filipino people’s yearning for
                freedom and self-determination. Through Kitty’s coming-of-age, the novel argues that true freedom comes from
                recognising and resisting oppression in society and within oneself.<br>

                        CONTEXT <br><br>
                        The beginning of the song showcases that the speaker acknowledges liking someone in the first stanza,
                        but finds it difficult to express it, possibly out of fear or uncertainty. They are reluctant to make contact because
                        they long desire for each other's privacy and only get in touch with each other when they request it. As the
                        songs progress to the pre-chorus, the singer portrays a strong will that their love won't fade away, showcasing a
                        sense of persistence to keep the relationship intact. The chorus invites the listener that whatever they seek for an  answer, the singer suggests it offers to seek in their heart as it implies a deeper understanding to that person and
                        exploring what they desire. The second verse showcases the singer’s desire for forgiveness as they admit their
                        flaws and the potential harm that could happen towards the person they love. The song ends with a bridge that
                        hints at fragility and introspection. The singer admits their own shortcomings and feels regret if they have
                        strayed from the course that their loved one had thought they would take.
                        The breakdown portion highlights the singer's difficulty in publicly expressing their love while restating
                        the main ideas of the opening verse.
